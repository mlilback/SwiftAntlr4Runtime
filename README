# Antlr4 Swift Runtime

Using [Swift in Antlr4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) as 
[detailed](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/swift-target.md)
is needlessly (for end-users) complicated. This package is meant to make it seamless.

It was created from [my fork](https://github.com/mlilback/antlr4) that 
includes fixes to the Swift runtime to be compatible with Swift 5. I will 
update this repo whenever changes happen to my antlr4 repository.

The only change I've made is to build a static library instead of a dynamic
one. Also included is the compiled antlr java app to generate code from a .g4 file.
